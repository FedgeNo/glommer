 * What the page cost to build, at the foot of it, for the admin alone.

 * Two numbers, because they answer different questions and each is misleading
 * without the other: how long the whole request took to assemble, and how many
 * statements went to the database doing it. A page that got slower is one or
 * the other, and the query count is the one that creeps - a listing grows a
 * query per row and nothing says so until somebody counts.
 *
 * Timed from the first line of init.php, so it covers the whole of building
 * the page rather than the tail of it. Rendered last, which is as close to the
 * true total as something that has to sit inside the page can get: what it
 * leaves out is only its own markup and the sending.
