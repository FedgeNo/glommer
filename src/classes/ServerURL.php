     * connected to Apache directly is local - almost certainly the reverse
     * proxy - and its X-Forwarded-For is trusted (last hop, since that's the
     * one the proxy itself appended). A non-loopback REMOTE_ADDR means
     * there's no proxy in front at all (this deployment is reached
     * directly), and X-Forwarded-For there is ignored entirely - trusting it
     * would let anyone fake a fresh IP on every request to dodge rate limits
     * and bans.
