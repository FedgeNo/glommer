/**
 * A button whose words change, that does not change size when they do.
 *
 * A row of buttons where one relabels itself shoves every neighbour along -
 * "Post" becoming "Schedule Post" moves the whole row, and the eye loses where
 * it was. So every label a button can show is built into it at once, stacked
 * in one grid cell with the inactive ones hidden but still measured. The
 * button is then as wide as its longest wording from the start and stays
 * there, whatever it currently says.
 *
 * Reserving each button's own longest label rather than giving them all one
 * width: a common width has to fit the longest label anywhere in the row, and
 * turns "Post" into a slab. The widths are never written down, so relabelling
 * or translating a button needs nothing here.
