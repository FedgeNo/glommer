 * second copy of the server's number, which is the drift this is meant to
 * avoid - so the defaults sit underneath whatever the cookie says.

// The other half - that a cookie predating a value still answers for it - has
// no test, and cannot get one cheaply: ClientConfig parses the cookie once and
// keeps it for the life of the page, which is right in a browser and means any
// test writing a cookie leaves its config behind for every suite that runs
// after it. Reaching for write_client_config() here is the trap; it passes and
// breaks something three files later.
