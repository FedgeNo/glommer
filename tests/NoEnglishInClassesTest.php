 * A converted class says only what the locale says.

 * The test that a class is finished is not "no sentences left in it" but no
 * words at all - a label on a button is as untranslatable as a paragraph if it
 * is written in the class. That is easy to get almost right and hard to see:
 * the page reads correctly in English either way, and the miss only shows when
 * somebody loads it in another language.
 *
 * So each class here is rendered under a locale where every string it owns has
 * been replaced by a marker, and the English it was written with must not
 * survive that. Anything still in the output came from the class.
 *
 * A class joins SUBJECTS when it is converted. That list is the checklist: a
 * class absent from it is a class nobody has done yet, and a class in it can
 * never quietly regress.
